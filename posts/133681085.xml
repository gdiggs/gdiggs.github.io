	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It's hard to call this a day. May 24 and 25 sort of mixed together, a result of traveling across time zones, and sleeping in a plane. The journey began at JFK airport. My flight, intended to leave at 7:55pm, ended up being delayed due to a thunderstorm. I think we left around 9:30. I took the opportunity to go to sleep, and was asleep when we took off. Taking off felt like going into hyperspace; it was fun.</p>
<p>The plane ride itself was uneventful, and the food followed suit. Most importantly, though, I arrived in Nice safely at around noon. Immigration was simple (why is it easier to get into another country than it is to return to my own?). I bought my bus pas and hopped a bus towards my hotel. The bus drove along the coast, and I began to see the beauty of Nice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you can see, it was beautiful and sunny when I arrived. Sadly, that weather didn't hold up. As I was walking to find food and a grocery store from my hotel, the rain began. Whatever, no big deal. Ate an awesome pain au chocolat and picked up the following from the store:</p>

<p>These fruit things are awesome. They're basically crackers with a chewy jelly inside. I'm keeping them in my bag for snacks. I've never had the 2 beers on the left before (tasting notes forthcoming), but Chimay Blue was a must, especially considering how cheap it is here.</p>
<p>Dinner was (as always) unplanned. I put on a nicer shirt and wandered out into the night. My normal tricks for finding restaurants didn't seem to work, though I think I might have been in the wrong part of town. Eventually, I came across La Maison Bleue on rue priv&eacute;e Meyerbeer. Apparently, the foie gras ravioli is incredible, though I didn't try it (may have to go back for it). Here's what I ate. The restaurant serves wine from a local vineyard, which I had, and it was awesome.</p>
<p><em>First course: Salade de la Mer</em></p>
<p>This is just as it sounds, a salade comprised of different things from the sea. If I remember correctly, it was mussels, calimari, shrimp, and maybe something else, too. They were all cooked fairly simply and were super tasty.</p>

<p><em>Second course: Filet de daurade r&ocirc;ti &agrave; la proven&ccedil;ale</em></p>
<p>I'd never had sea bream before. It's very tasty, kind of like sole, but with a tuna consistency. The lemon was a nice complement, and the sauce was incredible.</p>

<p><em>Third course: tarte de pomme</em></p>
<p>A perfect end to an amazing meal. This was as good as it looks, especially the cr&egrave;me anglaise</p>

<p>After dinner, I wandered back along the promenade to my hotel, full of great food, and really glad to be in Nice. I was exhausted and passed out watching France 2. Two days, rolled into one: a great start to the trip.</p>]]></content:encoded>
