<p>So, today was (is) <a href="http://www.recordstoreday.com/Home">Record Store Day</a>. There were some really good releases this year. My day started just before 7am, when I headed out towards <a href="http://www.facebook.com/pages/Double-Decker-Records/125444281003">Double Decker</a> in Allentown.</p>

<p>When I got to Double Decker around 7:20, there were some people already in line ahead of me. The kid in front is a senior in high school. He was visiting Muhlenberg for an accepted candidates day, and made his mom leave an hour early from Connecticut to get to Double Decker before his day at college. He had arrived at 5:55am. His mother was asleep in the car.</p>
<p>Double Decker opened at 8 and we all filed to the RSD section to make our selections. When I was paying, I noticed that their copy of the Teen Idles' <em>Minor Disturbance EP</em> was still there. Almost picked it up, but $550 was a little pricy for me.</p>
<p>After Double Decker, I headed over to <a href="http://cdcenterpa.com/">Compact Disc Center</a> in Bethlehem. I'd never actually been there, and they really live up to their name - it's mostly CDs. Nevertheless, the Dave Brubeck 10" caught my eye. They said they had had the Gorillaz 10", but had run out. Bummer.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of everything I got. The full list is <a href="http://empty-winter-789.heroku.com/?search=RSD+4%2F2012">here</a>. The Flaming Lips album is insane looking and sounds awesome. I'm excited to hear the new material from both The Black Angels and The Hives (that's a throwback group for me). Also, check out my sweet free totebag! I'm still on the hunt for the Frank Turner <em>I Still Believe 7"</em> (which I think may be a UK exclusive) and the Gorillaz 10".</p>
