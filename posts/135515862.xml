	<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I learned last night that I'm really bad at writing post cards. I don't remember the last time I did it, and that may be why. To me, it's a weird length to write, and when I'm 8 days into a 10 day trip, how do I catch the recipient up on everything? Regardless, I managed to scrounge up enough words to form something similar to sentences and wrote my cards. This morning, I went off to the post office to send them out. The postal workers were very helpful, and also very tolerant of my sheer ignorance as to how much to pay for a stamp and where to put the cards. The woman walked over to the machine with me and walked me through everything.</p>
<p>On the way to the post office was one of the Hotels de Ville of Nice. And, being that it is Saturday, weddings were in full force. Weddings in France are very different than in the US. For one, they are always held in the hotel de ville of the town in which one of the spouses live, rather than in a church. Some couples choose to have a church wedding as well as the legal ceremony, but it is increasingly rare. The mayor of the town oversees the weddings and signs the marriage licenses. Anyway, every Saturday, particularly in Nice, a crowd grows outside of the Hotel de Ville to celebrate the couples as they exit - there is confetti and cheering, not just for the couples known by the people outside, but for everyone who comes out. It's a very joyous and wonderful thing to see.</p>
<p>After the post office, I headed towards the used book market that I visited last Saturday. It happens the third and first Saturdays of the month, so I was lucky to be here for it twice. Since I was actually looking for it this time, I was able to spend some more time there. For one, it seemed bigger this time than last week, which was cool. The other thing that I noticed as I browsed the hundreds of books, BDs and prints was that it's not just about selling and buying books, it's about discussing books, pointing out rare ones or talking about favorites. I was tempted to ask for recommendations for some BDs, but I realized that only a few of them are pretty heavy and that would be weight I'd have to carry back home.</p>
<p>After the market, I went on the prowl for lunch. On a whim, I decided to head towards Place Garibaldi, the location of Cave de la Tour, a (supposedly) amazing raw seafood restaurant, who raises and sells their own oysters. They look incredible, and I wish I liked oysters so that I could eat there. As I was walking, I noticed, among the sandwiches, pizza and socca, a stand was selling hot dogs. I remembered suddenly that I had wanted to try a hot dog similar to this one when I was in Paris last and never got a chance, so I jumped on the opportunity. This was essentially a different take on a croque monsieur (a sandwich that is surpassed in tastiness by its female counterpart, the croque madame, which adds a soft-yolk egg to the top). The hot dog itself was placed in a small baguette, then covered in b&eacute;chamel sauce and draped with gruy&egrave;re cheese. It was simply amazing, and I may need to replicate it at home (though the danger of how easy making b&eacute;chamel sauce is may make me gain 50 or so pounds).</p>

<p>After lunch, I headed towards the Mus&eacute;e de la curiosit&eacute; et de l'insolite. I heard about this museum only after seeing a flyer for it at the Terra Amata museum a few days ago, and wasn't really all that sure what to expect. What I found is one of the most fun museums I've ever been to. The museum is at the former location of Barale, which as I learned was a famous restaurant in Nice. The museum itself features old automatic toys, animatronics, and illusions. It's run by one man, who is clearly very passionate about the subject. He's also, as evidenced by the certificate on the wall, a magician. I arrived at the same time as a small girl and her mother and we were given a tour of the seven rooms of the museum. Many things animate themselvers, others you press a button to see what they do. As part of the tour, you not only learn about object automation throughout history (going back even to the 17th and 18th centuries), but also get to see a small presentation in one of the rooms, which includes lots of cool automated events and ghosts. The owner was very excited that I was from the US (and even more excited that I was from New York), since I was the first american to visit his museum. He insisted I sign his guest book, which I gladly did. After spending some time pushing all the buttons I could, and looking at all the great toys, I headed back towards my hotel to relax in the park for a little while before dinner.</p>

<p>For dinner, I decided to go back to C&ocirc;t&eacute; Marais, mainly to try the Andouillette, which is a tripe sausage (or meta-intestine if you prefer). The staff instantly recognized and welcomed me back, apologizing that "my table" was reserved. The wiater helped me select a wine, and I noted that as he talked to other patrons just how much he knows about the wine selection at the restaurant. The selection is not small, it's written on a two-sided 4 foot tall board, and he could describe the qualities of each in detail. I started with scallops, which I don't normally like, but these were incredibly soft (not chewy, which is how I usually find them) and flavorful. The carmelized vegetables accented the flavor well. I then had the Andouillete, which has a very unusual and differrent flavor. It was incredibly tasty, but the flavor was not one you'd normally find. It's hard to describe, and I suppose the best way is to say that it was much more evident what part of the animal you were eating than it was with the tripes &agrave; la ni&ccedil;oise. The mustard sauce with it was incredible, and definitely helped dumb down the innard flavor just enough that it was still very present, but not overpowering. For dessert, I had the Mousse au Pavot, which is a while chocolate mousse with poppy seeds in it, which created an incredible texture. The pur&eacute;ed red fruits also added a nice little boost of sweetness as well.</p>

<p>While I was eating, a white cat appeared across the street, climbing in and out of the window as it built and lost courage to venture out. It ultimately retreated permanently back into the building.</p>
