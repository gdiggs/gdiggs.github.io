<div class='post_body'><p>Back in September, I attended Rocky Mountain Ruby in Boulder, CO. At the beginning of each day, <a href="https://twitter.com/mikegehard" target="_blank">Mike Gehard</a>&nbsp;led the entire group in a quick meditation. He raised a point about context switching in the work day, and about using meditation to regain focus and be more productive. I used to meditate a lot when I practiced yoga, and had not in a long time until September. Recently, as I and the Paperless Post team head into our busiest time of year, I found myself context switching much more often at work. For me, that is not a challenge. I enjoy jumping around to use my brain on many different things throughout the day, getting my hands dirty and juggling. What I find challenging is calming that excitement and energy at the end of the day. As I came home every day, still switching, and seeking something to restore some quiet, I came back to meditation. For just 5 minutes a day, right when I get home, I sit on my hard wood floor, and let the thoughts drift away from my mind. Yogic philosophy says that "the Self exists in the space between thoughts." I don't really care much about that, particularly because I like thinking as much as I do, but there is something to be said for the feeling of <em>not thinking</em>&nbsp;for a period of time. To just sit in quiet and in peace, for the longest 5 minutes of the day, relieves the need to jump around. So, in the end, like Mike said, meditation restores focus and eases the context switching.</p>
<p>Meditation is inherently not about thinking. Therefore, I view the opposite of mediation to be reflection: active thinking after some experience. Through reflection, we often find the lessons or the mere purposes for an experience. If it's an experience we repeat, then by reflecting upon it, we find its true value. I think this is an incredibly important act as well. I reflect mainly on what I learn every day, because learning is important. Immediately after graduating, I realized that no one would be forcing me to learn anymore. No one would impose a deadline for me to be required to spit back information and prove that I have learned hard facts or processes. For a short while, this was incredibly liberating. I had the freedom to not learn anything actively. I could let experiences come and go and just pick up whatever it was that I learned along the way. After a time, though, my desire and need to learn returned. Luckily, I am in a job where I learn every day. Some days, I learn more about how a certain piece of application code works, or how we use a specific technology. These acquisitions of knowledge, though beneficial, are not as useful as a more active search. Real learning takes digging and playing. So, every day, I try to dig and play as much as I can. Most days, I succeed. I learn about a language or a technology. I learn about grinds of coffee. I learn about food and beer. I learn about current events. And, most importantly, I reflect on the day, to fully find what I learned that day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is the pairing of meditation, not thinking, and reflection, thinking, that truly pulls a day together. It doesn't take long, no more than 10 minutes, but it makes everything much clearer.</p></div>
