<div class='post_body'><p>Today was the last day of the Cannes film festival (and the Grand Prix in Monte Carlo, more on that later). I decided to hop the train over to Cannes to check it out. You can't just go watch movie screenings, since the festival is an accredited affair, but there's lots of things happening to see. I got to the train station and got my tickets, and saw that I had about an hour to kill. There wasn't much to do around the Nice-Ville station, so I went and had a coffee. There was insanity among the people trying to get to Monaco. Never in my life have I seen so many well-dressed people so frantic all at the same time. This is exactly why I'm waiting to head over to Monaco, I want to let all the craziness of the Grand Prix pass, and also be able to walk in the streets, which is hard to do when there are cars racing in them.</p>
<p>Before all that, though, was breakfast. I found this spot in Vieux Nice. If you've never had a croissant choc amande, you've never lived. It is definitely my favorite French pastry. I didn't take a picture, but here's the place. I always have fun just looking at all the breads and pastries, there's a certain level of skill inherent in all their creations that is just impressive.</p>

<p>Ok, back to the journey to Cannes. Here's the Nice train station:</p>

<p>The train ride to Cannes is interesting - not the prettiest of trips, but it's fun to see the landscape. Arriving in Cannes, I followed the crowd (of mostly Americans and Brits) towards the festival grounds. There's a little carnival-like thing on the grounds, as well as a few expensive gift shops. The red carpet is big! I'm not sure how big I expected it to be, but it was definitely larger than I imagined. The press has to stay across the street when there are events going on, and they all have these ladders they stand on to get a better view. It looked like there were some press spots along the red carpet as well, though I'm not sure how it's decided who is where.</p>

<p>After this, it was lunch time. I headed into the little streets of Cannes, which are just lined with little shops. It reminded me of cities in Spain. A lot of places were closed because it is Sunday, but it was still nice. I had a sandwich in a good spot. It was basically a whole baguette filled with ham, cheese and accoutrements.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm not sure what it is about big hills that just make me want to prove I can get to the top, maybe it's all that time at Lehigh, but I found another hill and just had to climb it. At the top, I found the Cathedral d'Antibes. Sadly, the inside is under construction, and there's not much to see, but I checked out the Mus&eacute;e de la Caste, which is up there, too. it features pieces from cultures throughout history and was small, but fun. The views from up there were incredbile as well.</p>

<p>At the museum, there is this old guardtower that they used to use as a vantage point to spot attackers from miles away. It's the kind of thing that you always hear about, or see in movies, but it was really cool to see one in person, even if it wasn't the most visually striking structure. I considered climbing it, but remembered my bout with my fear of heights from yesterday, and used my better judgement.</p>

<p>I also found this fearless sea gull standing around, probably trying to get food from some tourists, and was able to get pretty close. I took pictures as I got closer, in case the thing flew away, and now I have almost 10 pictures, each with the bird a little larger. Good use of memory, there.</p>

<p>After some more wandering in Cannes, I was tired, and it was starting to rain, so I decided it was time to head back to Nice. I got to the SNCF station, and found out the 1:05 train was delayed 4 hours (typical SNCF, huh?). Lucky for me, it was almost 5:00, so it kind of worked out well. Then, when the train arrived, it was only two cars. So, 4 train loads of us loaded into a fraction of a train. It was pretty tight, but I managed to get a seat about halfway back to Nice.</p>
<p>I changed and headed out to dinner. I happened upon L'Escalinda. This is the kind of restaurant I've been looking for since I got to Nice. It's tiny, packed full of tables, and crowded. The staff is a bunch of guys all having a good time, laughing, yelling to each other, and playing little tricks on the patrons. For example, they have this big bowl of chickpeas and onions that they bring from table to table, but they make it seem like the whole bowl is part of the meal. The waiters yell to the bartender for drinks and he serves them quickly. The kitchen is upstairs, and the waiters constantly talk to and laugh with the chef over an intercom. There is no dessert menu, just some prepared desserts that you can pick from (and they all look amazing). I was absolutely stuffed at the end of the meal. And the food is increcible. Here's what I had:</p>
<p><em>First course: Panach&eacute; de Beignets</em></p>

<p><em>Second course: Boulettes de viandes &agrave; la ni&ccedil;oise et gnocchi</em></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/KVVOT.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p><em>Dessert: Tarte au citron meringu&eacute;e</em></p>
