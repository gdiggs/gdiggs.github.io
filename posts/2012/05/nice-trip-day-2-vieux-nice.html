<div class='post_body'><p>I came up with a name today for how I travel: accidental tourism (not to be confused with <em>The Accidental Tourist</em>). Really, this is what I do. I wander around and happen upon tourist attractions and visit them. The result of this is that my day becomes more focused on the journey, rather than the destination, since I usually don't have any idea where I'm going. I do pick destinations sometimes, but usually I just pick a direction and walk. It's pretty fun.</p>
<p>I started today in a search for breakfast. My hotel offers breakfast, but at 12&euro; a day, I figured I could do better. Ended up having a croissant amande and espresso. A great start to the day. While finding somewhere to sit and enjoy my croissant, I found this book market:</p>

<p>Lots of bandes desin&eacute;es and other French books. It was fun to look around (and actually see some books I've read!). The journey of today was in Vieux Nice. It's a touristy part of town, but there are lots of shops and markets and it's fun to look around and see things. Also, I love tiny, winding streets, and it has lots of them. The next market I found was the somewhat famous market at Cours Selaya. It featured plants, fruits, cheeses, meats, and other beautiful things that came from the earth. I sort of breezed through it, so I need to revisit. Two things that stood out were these giant stalks of lavendar and this awesome spice cart. More on this when I revisit:</p>

<p>Next, I headed over to the Mus&eacute;e de l'Art Moderne et l'Art Contemporaine (MAMAC). Entrance was free, which is pretty cool, and it was fun. Their current exhibition was kind of boring, but it might just be that I have a hard time getting behind 20 pieces titled "Object hung from the ceiling". I really liked the deconstruction in the pieces by Arman and the references to older art in the pieces of Yves Klein. Also, the room by Ben was totally awesome (I considered titling this post "Comment savoir si c'est de l'art ou pas?"). It reminded me of the whole punk/not punk debate, and how all that is totally useless at the end of the day. I thought the roof gallery was cool, and the views were amazing, but my fear of heights kicked in and I had to rush through them to get back inside.</p>

<p>After the museum, it was lunch time. I came across this pizza place which I stupidly didn't write down the name of it, but the pizza was good. It had olives, mushrooms and ham. Drank lots of water to stay hydrated (though bi&egrave;re pression is always so tempting). The people at the pizza place were super friendly, so I talked to them as I ate.</p>

<p>After lunch, I noticed a lot of roads were going uphill, and that I could see some form of mountainous thing at the top of them. So, it became my goal to get to the top. What I later realized is that I had arrived at Lou Cast&egrave;u, an old park/waterfall/church on top of the big hill. It seems that in the 18th and 19th centuries, they re-constructed these structures from the middle ages, so they still stand. And there was a waterfall. It was a lot of fun, and the views were amazing. I got sweaty.</p>

<p>I traveled back along the beach to my hotel, bathed, relaxed, and got ready for dinner. I wanted to go to Lou Pistou to have their tripes &agrave; la ni&ccedil;oise, but they are closed until Monday, so I shall return then and get my innards on. I wandered more through Vieux Nice for something good. I happened upon Le Maquis, intrigued by their Delices Ni&ccedil;ois, since I want to try a lot of local things.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, I'm off to Cannes for the last day of the festival, and to wander there!</p></div>
