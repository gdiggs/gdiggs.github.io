<div class='post_body'><p>Today is Mother's Day in France. Interestingly, Father's Day is the same date as in the US, and it sort of works since they're so close together. The day here is absolutely joyous. Similar to how everyone congratulated other couples on their wedding days, everyone says "Bonne F&ecirc;te" to any mother they see during the day. Flowers also play a big part in the day. Mothers receive and carry roses and bouquets all day. Lots of restaurants not normally open on Sundays were open for brunch or lunch today.</p>
<p>My own day began in Vieux Nice, as I returned to the pastry shop I've visited a few times to grab a croissant amande for the day. I also bought breakfast for tomorrow, since I won't have time to pick it up before I head to the airport. I had my croissant and a coffee in Place du Palais.</p>

<p>After this bit of fortification, I headed to the Th&eacute;atre de la Photographie et de l'Image, a museum of photographs. The current exhibit is of photos by Brass&iuml;. I felt kind of strange taking photos of photos, but I snapped a shot of one of the rooms to capture the general feel of the museum. The front room of the museum is dedicated to the history of the camera, with camera from throughout the centuries on display. The photos of Brassa&iuml; were incredible. They had a unique way of sucking you in and making you feel like you were really there. He depicted France in the early 20th century, specifically Paris and Nice between the two world wars. I look at art much more quickly than most people, but I was driven to take my time more with these photos. One of Brassa&iuml;'s quotes, printed on the wall, matched my feelings of Nice pretty well: "Nice et ses environs sont d'une fabuleuse beaut&eacute; m&ecirc;me par temps maussade. Le paradis devait avoir le m&ecirc;me aspect." / "Nice and its surroundings have a certain fantastic beauty, even in dull times. Paradise must have had the same aspect."</p>

<p>Part of the last day of a vacation is doing as many things that you know you want to do, but haven't had a chance to yet. My big one was eating a cr&egrave;pe, since they are one of my favorite French foods. In Paris, cr&egrave;pes are available at nearly every corner. In Nice, it's a bit more difficult to find one, and even more so to find savory cr&egrave;pes. Regardless, I knew where I had seen them, so I acquired one and sat on a bench by the beach to enjoy it.</p>

<p>On my way out of the photography exhibit, I had looked at the rack of brochures to see if there was anything else interesting I could check out, since I didn't have much planned for today. I found out that the gardens at Villa Arson were open today, and it was the last day of the three day exhibit. I had no idea what Villa Arson was, nor where it was, but that made me want to go check it out even more. I found out the address and took the tram north, almost to the end of the line. I think the area I was in is technically a part of Cimiez, the next town north of Nice (though it's all connected and there is no real division). The area is very quiet and residential. I would never have had any other reason to be up there if it weren't for this exhibit. The tiny streets of the area are lined with old villas, a stark constrast to the apartment buildings and hotels of southern Nice. As I walked the nearly deserted streets to the exhibit, I could smell Mothers' Day meals cooking, including the wonderful smell of fresh bread that wafted through the streets.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Villa Arson (which, by the way, is on top of yet another giant hill), I found out it is an art institute for contemporary art. Built on the site of an old villa, the institution also maintains a garden of non-native plants, such as palms from Senegal, and aloe and acacia plants. The free (as in beer and as in that there is no guide) tour takes you throught the garden, the institute, and the terraces, which offer great overlooks of Nice. There are also a number of installations done by former students of the institute. My favorite was Felice Varini's "Quatre points de vue" which was a three dimensional painting that created a circle from shapes painted on various surfaces when viewed from the right position. The terraces also hold a number of amphitheaters, where I believe classes can be held.</p>

<p>I headed back to my hotel briefly to check in to my flight and print my boarding pass, then headed back out to the Mus&eacute;e des Beaux-Arts, which is a little bit further west of the Mus&eacute;e Massena. On the way, I saw a band playing a show in a gazebo in the park. I listened for a moment, but wasn't impressed. The museum is inside an old mansion, and features art from the 16th to 20th centuries. Not my favorite styles, but I was impressed by the sheer size of some of the paintings (entire walls) and also liked the works by Gustav-Adolf Mossa, a painter from Nice. I, in a way, enjoyed the building more than the art, though I was baffled why it appeared that someone had painted white over murals on many of the walls. I also enjoyed this sculpture by Anonyme (amazing that s/he had time to sculpt after writing so many poems and hymns and painting so many pieces, right?) because it managed to really make it appear there was a veil over the face of the woman. After visiting the museum, and its small garden outside, I walked back along the beach, pausing to watch some brave souls parasail, which I could and would never do. I also drank a can of this carbonated iced tea, which was much better than I expected it to be. It pays to be adventurous!</p>

<p>For dinner, I came upon &nbsp;La Taca d'Oli. I started with a salad with warm ch&egrave;vre. I considered having the farcis, but knew as soon as the salad came that I had made the right decision. I hadn't had steak at all since arriving in Nice, so I had some tonight. One thing they never teach you in a French education is about how to order meat at different temperatures. All I've ever known is "bleu," which is basically just cooked long enough to sear each side (if even that) and "medium" which is comparable to an American medium-rare. Tonight I learned "rouge" from the waiter, who was very confused as to why we call steak "rare," which was a little rarer than you might find in the states if you ordered the steak rare. It was incredibly tasty. The steak itself was grilled with herbes de Provence, which I would not have thought to add to a steak, but the earthiness of the herbs complemented the steak flavor perfectly. The french fries were served with super spicy mustard, which was great. For dessert, I tried the Ile flottante, which is meringue floating in cr&egrave;me anglaise (it actually floats, too!). It was basically just sugar in a bowl, but there's nothing wrong with that every once in a while.</p>

<p>Whenever I travel, right around day 9 or so I start to get ansy and ready to go home. I think it's the way that I travel; I get tired of the unkown and the wandering. It set in a little bit yesterday, and a little more today. So, I took some time after dinner to walk around and say goodbye to the town I've come to love, the streets I've come to know. I walked along the promenade, looking out at the city all lit up, remembering when I went where, what I did, and how much fun I had. It occurred to me that this trip has been everything I had wanted it to be, and I would do it all again in an instant. Nevertheless, I am ready to go home, back to NYC, back to cellular data and reliable wifi. Back to texting and talking on the phone. Back to being in the same time zone as everyone else I know and back to not walking miles and miles every day. I think a part of any vacation is being reminded of what you have waiting upon your return, and, at least for a short time, having a renewed appreciation for that. But the most important thing to take away from a vacation is memories, and I have tons of those. Luckily, they don't add weight to my suitcase.</p>
<p>Au revoir, Nice. A bientot. Je t'aime.</p>
