<h3>Nice Trip - Day 8: My Own Monte Carlo Grand Prix</h3>

<div class='post_body'><p>I have a thing for small countries - I think it's interesting that in today's world, where a few huge countries control most everything, there are still tiny countries that can thrive on their own. So, when I found out how close Monaco was to Nice, I knew I needed to go (someday, I'll find a way into Andorra). Seriously, it takes less time and costs about the same to from Nice to Monaco round trip as it does to go from Grand Central to Wantagh in Long Island.</p>
<p>But before the voyage, I needed sustinance. I went back to the Italian festival on my way out to sample the porchetta sandwich, served on focaccia with some olive oil. It was super tasty. I also picked up an iced tea flavored with mango and pineapple. Seriously, why does Europe get all these cool iced tea flavors?</p>

<p>The train ride to Monaco is beautiful, since it goes right along the coast. The scenery isn't all that different than in Nice, but it's still pretty, even if it was somewhat overcast. Once in Monaco, I realized that it is the epitome of a town built into a mountain. Nice is also built into a mountain, but it's a more gradual one; Monte Carlo is basically a series of cliffs they built a city on. That makes navigation a bit difficult, since you can't really see very far in either direction, and maps aren't a huge help since often times where you want to go is on a different elevation, and you can't just jump off a cliff. Perhaps because of this, they have these really awesome signs that point out the way to walk for certain landmarks, museums, etc. They also note the nearest defribillator, which is good if you suddenly find yourself dying while wandering around Monte Carlo (in all seriousness, I'm sure the signs have saved some lives). I came out of the train station in kind of a weird spot, but began walking down some of the many stairs to hopefully find either wifi or a sign of direction. I finally found my way and came across the big market in Monaco, which features lots of local specialties for sale and consumption. Sadly, everything was closed, I think for the lunch hour, so I didn't get to see much of it. Then, I decided I would head towards the Prince's Palace and the Oceanographic museum, both of which were up this big set of stairs. From a strategic perspective, I'd say the palace is pretty safe.</p>

<p>At the top, I found the palace, and this pretty view.</p>

<p>I decided to do the tour of the Prince's Palace. Sadly, no photos were allowed inside (and I wasn't about to argue with the soldiers with guns about that point), but the guided audiotour was really cool. You go through a somewhat small part of the palace, but you get to see interesting rooms like Louis XV's bedroom, the courtyard with the big double helix stairs carved out of one solid piece of marble, and the throne room. You also get to hear about the ceremonial usage of each room that you're in and about the origins of many of the objects in the rooms. Fun fact: there's a large cistern under the courtyard of the palace that was built to collect rainwater so that it could supply water to the city in the case of a seige.</p>
<p>After the palace, while heading towards the oceanographic museum, I found the Saint Nicholas Cathedral. Inside is buried a number of former Monaco monarchs.</p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/5H0QU.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>After visiting the cathedral, I found myself at the Mus&eacute;e Oceanographique de Monaco. I have to say, this is one of the coolest museums I've ever visited. It's part art museum, part natural history museum, part panoramic viewing center, all with a sizeable aquarium at the bottom. They have preserved animals, old equipment, and some surpisignly shocking art pieces. The best part is that they are all intermixed, which throws you into this strange unbalance and is, in its own way, lots of fun. It's fun for the whole family, all at once! I also learned a lot, like that there are both seals and lobsters in the Mediterranean Sea, and the lobsters are huge. At the top of the museum, on the roof, is a scenic overlook, a museum, a playground and a turtle exhibit.</p>

<p>On my way to the Monte Carlo Casino, my last stop in Monaco, I stopped into the Jardin Saint-Martin, a botanical garden built onto a cliff. They have flowers, trees, statues, and a nice fountain, as well as incredible views of the port and coastline.</p>

<p>I then found my way through the streets of Monte Carlo to the casino. The grand prix was less than a week ago, so understandably the city is not entirely cleaned up. A lot of the stands and barriers are still in place. It was weird knowing that right next to where I was walking, they raced cars.</p>

<p>Around the casino, the streets are lined with high-end shops (Cartier, Armani, Ferragamo, etc.). The casino itself allows visitors into the lobby (no pictures, though). In order to get into the casino, you need to follow the strict dress code and pay admission. I was content to just be across the street, so didn't even bother going into the lobby. Casinos aren't really my thing; I'm not a huge gambler and so I don't really have any interest in it. The building was very pretty, though.</p>

<p>Now completely exhausted from the hiking and the sweating, I sat down in the park for half an hour to relax before heading back to Nice. I got lucky in that a train was leaving shortly after I arrived, so I got back to my hotel fairly quickly. For dinner, I decided I wanted pizza. I had wanted to try pizza in Monaco, given the Grimaldi history there and its relevance to my high school years in Brooklyn Heights, but I was quite tired and didn't feel like hanging around for a few more hours until dinner. Next time for sure. Back in Nice, I stopped at Attimi, a more modern restaurant near my hotel. Attimi prides itself on using locally-sourced, fresh ingredients for its dishes. I saw smoked swordfish on the menu, and had to have it, since I love swordfish and had never seen it smoked before. It was definitely fishy, but very tasty. I also got to have olive oil spiced with pimentos, which I love (and now that I know which kind of pepper they use, I can make it at home).</p>
<p><em>First Course: Pizza espadon fum&eacute;e (smoked swordfish)</em></p>

<p><em>Dessert: Mo&euml;lleux chocolat</em></p>
<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/uRk9q.jpg" alt="" width="450" /></p>
<p>I also, as usual, drank the house red, which was local and incredible. I'm really glad I've found a region of wines that I like, since I have, before this trip, never really enjoyed drinking wine.</p></div>
