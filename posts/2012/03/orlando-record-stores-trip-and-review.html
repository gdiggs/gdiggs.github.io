<p>I was in Orlando, FL for a few days, and was lucky to have a chance to go check out a few stores (thanks for the suggestions!). There&rsquo;s a Henry Rollins quote about how you can&rsquo;t really get a good feel for a town until you visit its record stores, so I always try to check them out whenever I go somewhere. This was by no means an exhaustive trip, but it was still fun and I wanted to share my findings:</p>

<p>The first stop on the trip was <strong><a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/retro-records-orlando">Retro Records</a></strong>. Maybe it was just that what I&rsquo;m interested in didn&rsquo;t really fit in with what he had, but I wasn&rsquo;t digging this place. Everything is sorted really well, but most used things were either of not great condition, over-priced, or both. Still, he has a <em>lot</em> of stuff, so that was cool. Didn&rsquo;t pick anything up there.</p>

<p>Next up was <strong><a href="http://www.parkavecds.com/">Park Ave CDs</a></strong>. This place is amazing. They have a huge selection of new stuff, and 2 categories of used records. One section is cleaned and graded. They have little cards on the top of the racks that explain in detail their grading and pricing procedures. Everything was well-priced and explained (many individual records also say why they were graded in a specific way). They also have a lot of CDs if you&rsquo;re looking for those. At the front of the store, they have these 15 record grab bags for $12 (you don&rsquo;t know what is in them). I grabbed one and was pleasantly surprised. Most of the time these grab bags are off-condition, crappy records, but these were pretty much all in very nice condition and not just super common things. My bag was an interesting mix of rock, pop, electronic, jazz, and others. Just really cool to hear some new music (and the Men Without Hats Album was a nice touch, too). The staff here is super helpful and friendly. I asked where the used records were, and rather than just pointing, the guy walked me over to the used section and explained everything to me. I talked to a few other people who worked there and they were really cool, too. The store has a whole box of Third Man Records items and a section of local/Florida bands.   <br />
<strong>Picked up:</strong> NOFX &ndash; 22 Songs&hellip;, Jack White &ndash; Love Interruption, Carl Sagan &ndash; A Glorious Dawn, 15 LP Grab Bag</p>

<p>The last stop was <strong><a href="http://rock-n-rollheaven.com/">Rock and Roll Heaven</a></strong>. This place is <em>huge</em>. Tons of rock, jazz, and a really big rap/hip-hop section. They also have a really large number of 45s. Most things seemed fairly priced. Some stuff was over-priced, but from what it looked like the rare stuff (at least what I knew to be rare) was fairly priced. Another really nice thing is that every genre was sorted by artist. Most stores I&rsquo;ve been to neglect at least one genre (ie. rock will be sorted, but there will just be a &lsquo;jazz&rsquo; section). Here, however, they spent the time to sort every section, and that made it really easy to find stuff.   <br />
<strong>Picked up:</strong> The Don Ellis Orchestra &ndash; Live in 3â…”/4 Time</p></div>
